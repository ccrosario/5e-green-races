Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.
:
Once you have raged the number of times shown for your raider level in the Rages column of the Barbarian table, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again.

#### Unarmored Defense

Orcs are trained from a very young age to fight, becoming able to defend themselves in battle. At 1st level, while not wearing armor your AC it's 10 + Strength or Dexterity modifier + Constitution modifier.

#### Sea Legs

The time you've spent on a rocking boat have trained your equilibrium. At 1st level, you have advantage on any ability checks made to keep your balance, and on checks or saving throws against effects that would knock you prone, plus gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.

#### Improved Feint

At 2nd level, you have become a tricky warrior, using cunning and deceptiveness to win your fights. You can use your bonus action on your turn to attempt to feint. You can choose to make a Charisma (Deception), (Performance) or Dexterity (Sleight of Hand), contested by the target's Wisdom (Insight), using your bonus action.
:
On a success, you have advantage on your next melee weapon attack made against that creature until the end of your turn.

#### Danger Sense

At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren't as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger.
:
You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you can't be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated.

#### Primal Path

At 3rd level, you choose a path that shapes the nature of your rage. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels.
:
You can choose from the Paths available to the Barbarian class. Some work with a few differences, as shown below.

#### Extra Attack

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

\column

#### Dirty Fighting

At 5th level, when you hit a creature with an attack made with advantage after a feint, you cause additional +1d6 damage. This damage increases to +2d6 at 11th level, and +3d6 at 17th level.

#### Unnatural Dodge

Starting at 7th level, you can react to danger before your senses would normally allow you to do so. You can take your turn normally when you are surprised.
In addition, enemies don't have advantage on attacks against you for being unseen, as long as they aren't invisible. You don't gain this benefit if you are incapacitated or immobilized.

#### Evasion

Beginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon's fiery breath or an ice storm spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

#### Breakpoint

At 9th level you can roll an additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage of a critical hit with a melee weapon.
:
If you have chosen this feature, you can also replace the Battle Cry feature to roll two additional dice at 13th level. If you have chosen this feature twice, you can replace Greater rage to roll three additional dice at 17th level.

#### Improved Dirty Fighting

At 11th level, after feinting successfully, you can take the Disengage action, or attempt to Shove or Grapple the target as part of the same bonus action. The shove or grapple attempt are made at advantage.

#### Battle Cry

At 13th level, you can unleash a powerful battle cry, that strikes fear in the hearts of your enemies. As an action, you can force all hostile creatures in a 30-foot radius to make a saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier). On a failed save, the target is frightened of you, until the end of your next turn.
:
Creatures with a CR or a Wisdom score higher than your Raider level automatically succeed on the check.

{{pageNumber,auto}}
{{footnote RAIDER}}

\page

#### Tireless Rage

Beginning at 15th level, your rage is so fierce that it ends early only if you fall unconscious or if you choose to end it.
:
In addition while raging, you can choose to suppress the effects of exhaustion for the duration of the rage. If you do so, you suffer 1 level of exhaustion at the end of the rage.

#### Greater Rage

At 17th level, when you enter in rage, or as a bonus action while raging, you can choose to turn it into a greater rage. While in greater rage, you gain the following benefits:
:
Your Strength and Constitution score raise to 26 for the duration.
You have resistance to all damage types.
You have advantage on all saving throws.
This benefit lasts for 1 minute. Once you use this feature, you can' t use it again until you finish a long rest, and you suffer a level of exhaustion.

#### Elusive

Beginning at 18th level, you are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll has advantage against you while you aren't incapacitated.

#### Blessing of the Tribe

At 20th level, you gain the blessing of an Orc god. Choose one of the following: Bahgtru, Gruumsh, Ilneval, Luthic, Shargaas, or Yurtrus. You gain the power correspondent to the chosen god. You cannot change the power after choosing it.
:
**Bahgtru.**
Your weapons are infused with the might of The Son of Gruumsh. All melee weapons you wield gain the thrown (20/60) property, or double the thrown distance if they already have this property.
:
In addition, once per turn when you hit a creature with an attack from a melee weapon or unarmed strike, you cause additional 2d6 force damage to the target, and that creature is knocked 10 feet back.
:
Finally, choose a Favored Enemy. On a critical hit against your Favored Enemy, the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against the damage dealt, or is reduced to 0 hit points.
:
**Gruumsh.** You channel the divine powers of He Who Watches. You have truesight up to a range of 30 feet.
:
In addition, when you finish a short or a long rest, roll a d20 and record the number rolled. You can replace any attack roll, saving throw, or ability check made by you or a creature that you can see with this foretelling roll. You must choose to do so before the roll.
:
Once you use your foretelling roll once, it is spent. When you finish a short or a long rest, you lose any unused foretelling rolls.
:
**Ilneval.**
You have developed a sharp mind around warfare and tactics, which pleases The Lieutenant of Gruumsh. Your Wisdom score increases by 4, up to a maximum of 24.
:
In addition, you can cast a spell of 5th-level or lower from any spell list. When you cast the spell, you can't do it again until you finish a long rest. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for this spell.
:
**Luthic.**
You have developed a certain cunning in your fighting style. You can cast Dimension Door, Blur and Mirror Image each once, without spending a spell slot. When you do so, you can't do it again until you finish a short or a long rest.
:
**Shargaas.**

:
In addition, you can give yourself a bonus of +10 to an attack roll you make. Once you do it, you can't do it again until you finish a long rest.
:

## Primal Paths

### Path of the Berserker

For some raiders, rage is a means to an end – that end being violence. The Path of the Berserker is a path of untrammeled fury, slick with blood. As you enter the berserker's rage, you thrill in the chaos of battle, heedless of your own health or well-being.

#### Frenzy

Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can go into a frenzy when you rage. If you do so, for the duration of your rage you can attack one additional time whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. You can only make melee attacks while in a Frenzy.
:
When the rage ends, you must make a Constitution saving throw against a DC of 15. On a failed save, you suffer 1 level of exhaustion. Regardless of failure or success, your DC raises by 5.
:
Your DC returns to 15 when you finish a long rest.

{{pageNumber,auto}}
{{footnote RAIDER}}

\page

#### Mindless Rage

Beginning at 6th level, you can't be charmed or frightened while raging. If you are charmed or frightened when you enter your rage, the effect is suspended for the duration of the rage.

#### Intimidating Presence

Beginning at 10th level, you can use your action to frighten someone with your menacing presence. When you do so, choose one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn.
:
On subsequent turns, you can use your action to extend the duration of this effect on the frightened creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends if the creature ends its turn out of line of sight or more than 60 feet away from you.
:
If the creature succeeds on its saving throw, you can't use this feature on that creature again for 24 hours.
:
While raging, you can use your Intimidating Presence as a reaction whenever a hostile creature moves within 30 feet of you or start its turn within that range.

#### Retaliation

Starting at 14th level, when you take damage from a creature that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature.

### Path of the Totem Warrior

The Path of the Totem Warrior is a spiritual journey, as the raider accepts a spirit animal as guide, protector, and inspiration. In battle, your totem spirit fills you with supernatural might, adding magical fuel to your rage.
:
Most tribes consider a totem animal to be kin to a particular clan. In such cases, it is unusual for an individual to have more than one totem animal spirit, though exceptions exist.

#### Spirit Seeker

Yours is a path that seeks attunement with the natural world, giving you a kinship with beasts. At 3rd level when you adopt this path, you gain the ability to cast the Beast Sense and Speak with Animals spells, but only as rituals.

#### Totem Spirit

At 3rd level, when you adopt this path, you choose a totem spirit and gain its feature. You must make or acquire a physical totem object – an amulet or similar adornment – that incorporates fur or feathers, claws, teeth, or bones of the totem animal. At your option, you also gain minor physical attributes that are reminiscent of your totem spirit. For example, if you have a bear totem spirit, you might be unusually hairy and thick-skinned, or if your totem is the eagle, your eyes turn bright yellow.
:
Your totem animal might be an animal related to those listed here but more appropriate to your homeland. For example, you could choose a hawk or vulture in place of an eagle.
:
**Bear.** While raging, you have resistance to all damage except psychic damage. The spirit of the bear makes you tough enough to stand up to any punishment.
:
**Eagle.** While you're raging and aren't wearing heavy armor, other creatures have disadvantage on opportunity attack rolls against you, and you can use the Dash action as a bonus action on your turn. The spirit of the eagle makes you into a predator who can weave through the fray with ease.
:
**Elk.** While you're raging and aren't wearing heavy armor, your walking speed increases by 15 feet. The spirit of the elk makes you extraordinarily swift.
:
**Panther.** While raging, you can add 10 feet to your long jump distance and 3 feet to your high jump distance. The spirit of the panther empowers your leaps.
:
**Wolf.** While you're raging, your friends have advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature within 5 feet of you that is hostile to you. The spirit of the wolf makes you a leader of hunters.

#### Aspect of the Beast

At 6th level, you gain a magical benefit based on the totem animal of your choice. You can choose the same animal you selected at 3rd level or a different one.
:
**Bear.** You gain the might of a bear. Your carrying capacity (including maximum load and maximum lift) is doubled, and you have advantage on Strength checks made to push, pull, lift, or break objects.
:
**Eagle.** You gain the eyesight of an eagle. You can see up to 1 mile away with no difficulty, able to discern even fine details as though looking at something no more than 100 feet away from you. Additionally, dim light doesn't impose disadvantage on your Wisdom (Perception) checks.
:
**Elk.** Whether mounted or on foot, your travel pace is doubled, as is the travel pace of up to ten companions while they're within 60 feet of you and you're not incapacitated. The elk spirit helps you roam far and fast.
:
**Panther.** You gain proficiency in two skills from the following list: Athletics, Acrobatics, Stealth, and Survival. The cat spirit hones your survival instincts.

{{pageNumber,auto}}
{{footnote RAIDER}}

\page

**Wolf.** You gain the hunting sensibilities of a wolf. You can track other creatures while traveling at a fast pace, and you can move stealthily while traveling at a normal pace.

#### Spirit Walker

At 10th level, you can cast the Commune with Nature spell, but only as a ritual. When you do so, a spiritual version of one of the animals you chose for Totem Spirit or Aspect of the Beast appears to you to convey the information you seek.

#### Totemic Attunement

At 14th level, you gain a magical benefit based on a totem animal of your choice. You can choose the same animal you selected previously or a different one.
:
**Bear.** While you're raging, any creature within 5 feet of you that's hostile to you has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you or another character with this feature. An enemy is immune to this effect if it can't see or hear you or if it can't be frightened.
:
**Eagle.** While raging, you have a flying speed equal to your current walking speed. This benefit works only in short bursts; you fall if you end your turn in the air and nothing else is holding you aloft.
:
**Elk.** While raging, you can use a bonus action during your move to pass through the space of a Large or smaller creature. That creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC 8 + your Strength bonus + your proficiency bonus) or be knocked prone and take bludgeoning damage equal to 1d12 + your Strength modifier.
:
**Panther.** While you're raging, if you move at least 20 feet in a straight line toward a Large or smaller target right before making a melee weapon attack against it, you can use a bonus action to make an additional melee weapon attack against it.
:
**Wolf.** While you're raging, you can use a bonus action on your turn to knock a Large or smaller creature prone when you hit it with melee weapon attack.

## Multiclassing

:
**Prerequisites.** To qualify for multiclassing into the raider class, you must meet these prerequisites: 13 Strength, 13 Constitution.

#### Skirmish Tactics

As a Slinger, your place in the battlefield is not to be in the frontline, but in the back peppering down the enemy with bullets from afar. Starting at 2nd Level, you can now Dash and Disengage as a Bonus action.

#### Slinger Archetype

Starting at 3rd Level, your character can now specialize in a role that they would be known for. The roles that can be picked are: Boulder Slinger and Runic Slinger. Your choice grants features at the 3rd level, and again at the 6th, 9th, and 14th.

#### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach the 4th Level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

#### Extra Attack

Starting at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. The number of attacks increases to three at 11th level in this class.

#### Stunning Shot

Starting at 5th Level, you are proficient enough in the slings that your sling attacks can now effectively daze the enemy. Once per round, when you managed to hit a creature with a sling attack, you can turn that hit into a Stunning Shot. The target must succeed on a DC (8 + Proficiency + Dexterity) Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn. You may use this feature a number of times equal to your Dexterity modifier before needing a short/long rest.

#### Agile

Starting at 7th Level, you have learned to move more efficiently with less energy. Your Movement Speed is increased by 15ft and you are no longer hampered by nonmagical difficult terrain.

#### Ricochet

Starting at 8th Level, you are now able to shoot a bullet that can effectively ricochet onto incoming enemy foes. As an Action, you make a single attack roll with a sling against a target, of which it may be a creature, object, or surface. If the attack hits, it would ricochet onto another target of your choice that's within 15ft of the original target, using the same attack roll. This process would repeat until it hits 5 targets or it misses. You may use this feature a number of times equal to your Dexterity modifier before needing a long rest.

\column

#### Marked for Death

Starting at 13th Level, you have learned to effectively study a creature and mark its weaknesses for you to exploit. You can now use your Bonus action to mark a single creature, the mark lasting for one minute. You now deal criticals on rolls of 18-20 made with the sling against the marked creature. This further increases to rolls on 16-20 at the 18th Level. If the marked creature drops to 0 Hit Points before the mark ends, you can use a Bonus Action on a subsequent turn of yours to mark a new creature. You may use this feature a number of times equal to your Dexterity modifier before needing a short/long rest.

#### Supreme Aim

Starting at 17th Level, your aim is so great that no one can compare to you. You can now use your Bonus action to grant yourself Advantage for all attacks on the same turn. You may only use this feature twice, regaining all uses after a long rest.

#### Legendary Slinger

Starting at 20th Level, the actions and feats you have accrued as a Slinger have made you a legend amongst them, cementing your life as an inspiration and story to be passed along for generations. Once per turn, you can declare one of your sling attacks to be a Legendary Shot. You may declare it before or after you make the attack roll, but must do so before the DM can tell you if the attack hits. If that attack hits, you may double the result of the damage roll. If it's a critical, you may triple the result of the damage roll.

## Slinger Discipline

### Power Slinger

Among Slingers, Power Slingers are those who decided that regular sling bullets are just not enough and have decided to fling bullets double their usual size, often times being compared to as boulders when compared to regular sling bullets, their heavier ammunition easily deals traumatic blows.

#### Heavy Rocks

Starting at Level 3, the rocks you sling are much more heavier than your regular counterparts. You can now add an additional 1d6 Damage to all sling attacks.

#### Traumatic Shot

Starting at Level 6, the weight of your ammunition causes more trauma. Your Stunning Shot is now instead Traumatic Shot, the DC now being a DC (10 + Proficiency + Dexterity) Constitution saving throw or be Stunned until the end of your next turn.

{{pageNumber,auto}}
{{footnote SLINGER}}

#### Heavy Swings

Starting at Level 14, you have learned to effectively use your strength to fuel your swings. While using a Sling, you can now add half(rounded up) of your Strength modifier to all Damage rolls (minimum bonus of +1).

### Rune Slinger

As Slingers have come to travel all over the world, some have come to find the utility of runes and magic very useful in their line of work, specifically the art of runes. Rune Slingers are those who've endeavored to master the art of runes, their study paying off as their rune infused bullets deal the power of the forces of nature.

#### Runed Ammunition

Starting at Level 3, you now have learned the ancient art of runes. You can now make runes on your sling ammunition to make them magical, allowing them to either do Fire, Cold, or Lightning damage. You can convert 10 regular sling ammunition into 10 Runed sling ammunition for 30 minutes, of which may be part of your short or long rest.

#### Arcane Hex

Starting at Level 6, your shots don't just deal trauma, but curses as well. Your Stunning Shot now deals an extra effect on a success depending on the damage type the Runed ammunition used.

- **Fire.** The target takes fire damage equal to that dealt by your Stunning Shot at the start of their next turn after the Stunned condition has worn off.
- **Cold.** The target's speed is reduced by 15 feet at the start of their next turn after the Stunned - condition has worn off.
- **Lightning.** The target takes lightning damage equal to half that dealt by your Stunning Shot and its speed is reduced by 5 feet at the start of their next turn after the Stunned condition has worn off.

#### Fortified Ammunition

Starting at Level 9, you have come to learn new runes that you can etch into your ammunition. You can now make your Runed Ammunition do Force, Radiant, or Necrotic damage.

#### Hex Master

Starting at Level 14, you have come to unlock the curses in your new runes as well. Your Stunning Shot now deals an extra effect on a success depending on the damage type the Runed ammunition used.

- **Force.** Restrains the target for one turn at the start of their next turn after the Stunned condition has worn off.
- **Radiant.** Blinds the target for one turn at the start of their next turn after the Stunned condition has worn off.
- **Necrotic.** Poisons the target for one turn at the start of their next turn after the Stunned condition has worn off.

Boneshakers among the orcs are revered as mystics and feared as powerful combatants, blending arcane might with ferocious battle prowess.

#### Spellcasting Ability

Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your boneshaker Spells, as
your magic comes from your deep seated traditions and mystic
ancestry. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your
spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier
when setting the saving throw DC for a boneshaker spell you cast
and when making an attack roll with one.
:
Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom
modifier
:
Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your
Wisdom modifier
:

#### Preparing Spells

To cast spells you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or
higher. You gain spell slots from use of the Spirit Communion
ability. You prepare the list of boneshaker Spells that are available
for you to cast, choosing from the boneshaker spell list. When you
do so, choose a number of boneshaker Spells equal to your
Wisdom modifier + your boneshaker level (minimum of one spell).
These spells all must be of a level equal to or less than your
current spell cap.
:
You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a
long rest. Preparing a new list of boneshaker Spells requires time
spent in harmony with your ancestors; at least 1 minute per
spell level for each spell on your list.

#### Ritual Casting

You may also cast boneshaker spells as rituals if they have the
ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.

#### Spell Cap

Your mortal body cannot withstand the full might of spirit magic
and must acclimate to channeling their power incrementally
over time. Though the spirits may offer you spell slots of higher
levels, you may only create spell slots up to your spell cap. For
example, at 1st level, you may only make spell slots of 1st level
even though your spirit communion die roll may be as high as 2.
The Spell Cap limits the upper extreme of spells you may cast
and is detailed in the boneshaker table.
:
The oldest of spirits are draining to use and cannot be done
frequently. You may only cast one spell at 9th level. Once you
do so, you may not do so again until after you have completed
a long rest.

#### Spellcasting Focus

You can use a boneshakeric fetish (see the boneshaker Gear section)
as a spellcasting focus for your boneshaker spells.

\column

#### Spirit Communion

Starting at 1st level, your devotion to the spirit realm has granted you a better
connection to the immaterial than your peers. You seek the aid
of spectral allies everyday, and they respond to you with trust
and familiarity. These spirits may grant you guidance, aid in
combat, or other boons as you gain levels in this class.
:
As a bonus action, you may conduct Spirit Communion and
select a Communion Boon available to you. Then you may roll a
communion die if the boon calls for it. Roll a d2 to commune
with the ancient spirits and implore them for aid. This die roll
result replaces X for whichever task you choose.
:
The boneshaker table shows how many uses you have of Spirit
Communion. You regain all expended uses of Spirit
Communion after completing a long rest. Additionally the die
you use for spirit communion increases at certain levels as
shown in the boneshaker table.

#### Communion Boons

:
**Spirit Commune.** You summon a helping spirit, usually
a familiar entity that you have contacted through meditation
and ritual. These spirits may be ancestral spirits, former
members of your tribe who now seek to aid you, or banished souls you wish to dominate. These may
be spirits your tribe has used for generations, the knowledge
and familiarity of each passed down from parent to child.
These may be spirits you have personally sought out,
sometimes dangerous and mysterious. No matter the origin
of your relationship, these spirits will seek to aid you in
whatever way they can. Roll a communion die and choose
yourself or a creature you can see within 30 feet of you.
They gain a +X bonus to all skill checks made using an
ability score of your choice, chosen when you bestow this
boon, as the spirit guides and assists them. Certain spirits
will usually help with certain ability scores. This boon lasts
for up to 1 hour, but only one person may benefit from this
boon at a time. If you bestow this boon on a new creature,
the previous boon ends immediately.
:
**Spirit Magic.** You beseech an arcane spirit to cast a spell
using you as a conduit. Roll a communion die and create a
spell slot of level X or lower which you may use to cast
boneshaker spells. A spell slot made in this way lasts for 1 hour,
and if you use Spirit Magic again, you lose the previous spell
slot made using this feature. After you use a spell slot
created by this feature, you lose it completely.

{{pageNumber,auto}}
{{footnote BONESHAKER}}

\page

#### Boneshaker Cults

Starting at 2nd level, you’ve fully embraced certain traditions and moral
adherences of a particular sect of boneshakers within your tribe.
These traditions are passed down each generation by the
oldest and wisest. Choose one of these cults as it suits
your background or character decisions; Legion of Bahgtru,
the Shargaasan Order, the Circle of Spirits, or the Apostates.
Your choice grants you additional benefits for your Spirit
Communion at 2nd level. Your choice also grants you additional
features at 3rd, 6th, 10th, and 18th level.

#### Communal Memory

Starting at 2nd level, you gain the ability to reach out to the local spirits, asking for
their guidance or probing for information. As an action, summon one of these spirits to aid
you. Choose one of the following benefits:

- You ask a single question about a specific goal, event, or activity that might have happened within the last 24 hours around the area, usually within 1 mile of you. Spirits will answer this to the best of their knowledge, usually in a short phrase, cryptic rhyme, or an omen. As you gain levels in this class, you can seek out older, wiser spirits for guidance. At 5th level you may ask about events up to one week old, at 9th level up to one month, at 13th level one year, and at 17th ten years. (The quality of information may also increase with your levels in this class, at your DM’s discretion.)
:
- The spirit will offer you some of its knowledge. Choose one of the spells you have prepared. Replace it with another boneshaker Spell. This spell must be of a level equal to or less than your current spell cap.

:
You can use Communal Memory a number of times equal to your
proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you
finish a long rest.

#### Ancestral Mastery

Starting at 7th level, your control over the spirits has grown strong, allowing you
to swiftly choose the appropriate spirit when you ask for their
aid. Whenever you roll a communion die, you may assert your
control over the spirits to reroll the die and then choose either
result. Once you do this, you may not do so again until after you
finish a long rest.

Starting at 17th level, you can do this twice before a rest, but
only once on the same turn.

#### Revered Among the Dead

Starting at 14th level, through your dedication to your boneshakeric path, you have
gained a special audience with some of the oldest and most
revered spirits of your tradition. These spirits are collectively the
masters of all trades and forms of Magic, and they can enter
your mind to grace you with knowledge of spells outside your
normal reach.
:
As a bonus action, you gain the knowledge
necessary to cast a single spell from any class, (including this
one). You name this spell, and may cast it once within the next
10 minutes without expending a spell slot. This spell counts as
a boneshaker spell for you and must obey all the rules of your Spell
Cap. Once you cast the spell, the spell’s knowledge leaves you,
and you may not use this ability again until after you have
completed a long rest.

#### Wisdom Unbound

Starting at 20th level, your knowledge of the afterlife’s bridge and the meaning of all
life has reached a level unmatched by most mortals. Your
Wisdom score increases by 4 to a maximum of 24, and you no
longer have to prepare spells from the boneshaker spell list in order
to cast them. You have gained innate spiritual knowledge of the
entirety of the boneshaker spell list.

## Cults

:
In the shadows of orc society lie enigmatic cults, shrouded in mystery and primal fervor. These cults worship ancient deities of war, chaos, and primal forces, seeking power through forbidden rituals and dark magic. Led by charismatic boneshakers and ruthless warlords, orc cults draw followers with promises of strength and dominance, often challenging traditional tribal hierarchy. Fueled by a primal urge for conquest and a hunger for arcane knowledge, these cults embody both the fearsome potential and perilous allure of orcish spirituality unleashed.

### Legion of Bahgtru

Those who follow Bahgtru proudly continue a
legacy of blood and violence. Being the most common tradition
amongst the various orcish cults, the path of Bahgtru
is one of conflict and competition as each tribe seeks to exalt
their own traditions and practices, leading to much friction
between tribes.

#### Expanded Spell List

Starting at 2nd level, the spirits of orc champions slain in battle teach you the secret of weaving spells into your attacks.

The following Spells are added to the boneshaker spell list for you:

| Spell Level | Spells                             |
| :---------: | :--------------------------------- |
|     1st     | Thunderous Smite, Armor of Agathys |
|     2nd     | Branding Smite, Blur               |
|     3rd     | Crusader's Mantle, Blinding Smite  |
|     4th     | Staggering Smite, Fire Shield      |
|     5th     | Banishing Smite, Steel Wind Strike |

#### Warchant Initiate

Starting at 2nd level, your ancestral warrior heritage has hardened you for combat,
and you gain another Communion Boon with which you can use
your Spirit Communion die.
:
**Spirits of Battle.** The spirits of your tribe are great
warriors, bloodsoaked and hungry for battle. Roll a communion
die and choose a weapon wielded either by yourself or by an
ally that you can touch. That weapon gains a bonus to its attack
and damage rolls equal to the rolled value on your communion
die for a number of attacks equal to your Wisdom modifier
(minimum of one). If you do not make the total number of
available attacks within an hour, the Spirit leaves the weapon.
Only a single weapon may gain this boon, and if you bestow
this boon on another weapon, the previous boon ends
immediately.

#### War Trance

Starting at 3rd level, your blood runs hot and fast as you embrace a Legion
tradition called the War Trance. Whenever you make a melee
weapon attack, you may choose to enter a War Trance before
you roll to attack.
\column
You may also choose to enter your War
Trance whenever you cast a spell that requires concentration
(no action required). This trance lasts for up to 1 minute. While
in your War Trance, you receive the following benefits and
restrictions:

- If you are concentrating on a spell, your concentration on
that spell cannot be broken by taking damage, but you
cannot cast spells of 1st level or higher.
- Your speed is halved but cannot be reduced any further
unless it is reduced to 0 outright.
You cannot take a reaction.
- When you make a melee weapon attack, you gain a bonus
to the damage roll equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum
of 1).
- You gain a +3 bonus to your AC.

:
You may enter a War Trance twice and regain the ability to do
so again after a long rest. You gain another use of this feature
at 6th level and one more at 18th level.

#### Extra Attack

Starting at 6th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever
you take the attack action on your turn.

#### Spirit Mount

Starting at 10th level, the charging war chiefs of your tribe send the
spirits of their most trusted mounts to aid you. You gain the
ability to cast the spell find greater steed without expending a
spell slot. After doing so, you must finish a long rest before you
can do so again.

#### Mantle of the Warchief

Starting at 18th level, you can choose to become possessed by a
powerful spirit of war, your tribe's greatest ancestral spirit, your
Gashna. As an action, you can become an avatar of war and gain
the following benefits:

- You gain temporary hit points equal to 3 times your boneshaker
level.
- You have advantage on all attack rolls
- You melee attacks deal an additional 2d10 weapon damage
on hit.
- You can choose a number of creatures equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1) that you can see within 30 feet of you. They gain advantage on all melee weapon
attacks.

:
These benefits last for up to a minute, and once you use this
feature, you cannot do so again until after you finish a long rest.

### The Shargaasan Coven

The coven is an old and often maligned
cult. They are associated with the dark, hidden boneshakers who
tend to seclude themselves in the study of their curses. Only some
who follow the Shargaasan way are truly evil but most are generally condescending and cruel in their dealings. Some young boneshakers may adopt these
traditions hoping to reverse some terrible magical ill that has
befallen their people. Even with the best of intentions, they usually
find the dark magic of the corrupted and banished orc spirits to be destructively
seductive.

#### Expanded Spell List

Starting at 2nd level, the spirits of misfortune teach you the secret of additional
spells. The following Spells are added to the boneshaker spell list
for you.

| Spell Level | Spells                                 |
| :---------: | :------------------------------------- |
|     1st     | Cause Fear, Ray of Sickness            |
|     2nd     | Ray of Enfeeblement,  Phantasmal Force |
|     3rd     | Dispel Magic, Fear                     |
|     4th     | Confusion, Phantasmal Killer           |
|     5th     | Geas, Dominate Person                  |

#### Soulsapper Initiate

Starting at 2nd level, your fledgling foray into the secrets of Shargaas has granted
you another Communion Boon with which you can use your
Spirit Communion ability.
:
**Spirits of Misfortune.** The spirits you seek are malignant,
sinister entities whose purpose is to curse and spite. Roll a
communion die and spend 10 minutes performing a ritual to
summon a number of Spirits of Misfortune equal to X+1. These
invisible spirits remain with you for the next 8 hours as though
haunting you, giving you a dark, undead aura. While they are
present, people around you might hear distant whispers or feel
the tap of spectral fingers. If you wish to perform another ritual
to summon more Spirits of Misfortune, you must first dismiss
any Spirits you have remaining as an action.
Whenever a creature you can see within 60 feet of you
makes an attack roll or ability check, you can use your reaction
to use any number of your Spirits of Misfortune to curse the
creature attempting the roll. Subtract 1d6 from that roll for every
Spirit you use in this way. You can choose to send these Spirits
after the die is rolled but before the outcome is known.

#### Curse Trance

Starting at 3rd level, you erupt with a dark energy, amplifying the power of your
curses. When a creature fails a saving throw against one of
your spells, you may choose to enter a Curse Trance (no action
required). You may also choose to enter your Curse Trance as
a bonus action. This trance lasts for up to 1 minute. While in
your Curse Trance, you receive the following benefits and
restrictions:

- If you are concentrating on a spell, any creature that must make a saving throw during its turn to free itself from the effects of your spell must do so with disadvantage, even if another effect would give it advantage, but you cannot cast another spell of 1st level or higher.

- As an action, you may choose to use any number of your Spirits of Misfortune to deal 1d6+1 necrotic damage per spirit expended to a target you can see within 60 feet of you.

- Your speed is halved but cannot be reduced any further unless it is reduced to 0 outright.

- You cannot take a reaction except to use your Spirits of Misfortune feature.

:
You may enter a Curse Trance twice and regain the ability to do
so again after a long rest. You gain another use of this feature
at 6th level and one more at 18th level.

#### Hex Syphon

Starting at 6th level, you have become skilled in exploiting the weakness of the
victims of your spells. The first time that a creature fails its
saving throw against one of your spells, that creature is dealt
extra necrotic damage equal to one roll of your communion die,
and you regain hit points equal to the necrotic damage dealt as
you absorb a portion of your target’s life force.

#### Shargaasan Fetish

Starting at 10th level, you can spend 1 hour creating a special fetish that stores the
blackest of magics. You can use this fetish as a spellcasting
focus for yourself or give it to another creature. A creature gains
a benefit of your choice as long as the fetish is in the creature's
possession. When you create the fetish, choose the benefit
from the following options:

- When you force a creature to make a Wisdom saving throw, you may use your reaction to impose disadvantage on their roll. (After doing this, the fetish crumbles into dust.)
- You gain the ability to speak all language.
- If you would drop to 0 hit points as a result of taking damage, you instead drop to 1 hit point. If you are subjected to an effect that would kill you instantly without dealing damage, the effect is negated against you. (After either of these effects activate, the fetish crumbles into dust.)
- You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws.
- You gain resistance to necrotic, acid, poison, or psychic damage (your choice whenever you choose this benefit).

Each time you cast a boneshaker spell of 1st level or higher, you
can change the effect of your fetish if the fetish is on your
person. If you create a new fetish, the previous one ceases to
function.

#### Banished Spirit

Starting at 18th level, you may use your action to summon the banished soul of a dishonored ancestor to aid in the
deconstruction of conjurations and the shepherding of souls
back from the brink of the beyond.
:
This banished spirit manifests as a
translucent incorporeal image of a long dead ancestor, it
appears at your side and remains on this plane of existence for
one minute. The spirit emits an aura with a 10-foot-radius of viscous fog.
This aura is an area of antimagic consistent with the antimagic
field spell. It is a translucent, inky void the color of your choice
which miraculously obscures nothing within or behind itself.
:
While the spirit is summoned, you can use your action to
command them to move up to 60 feet to a point you can see or
to attach themselves to a creature you can see within 60 feet. If
the spirit is attached to a creature, it will move with the creature
when it moves. Creatures cannot interact with the spirit even if
they have the ability to enter the ethereal plane.
:
Additionally, if a creature you can see within 60 feet would
drop to 0 hit points, you may use your reaction to bring them to
1 hit points instead and make them immune to all damage for
the rest of the turn. Doing so requires the last of the spirit’s
strength, dismissing them immediately at the end of the turn.
Once you summon the Banished Spirit, you may not do so again until after you complete a long rest.

### Circle of Spirits

Those in the circle are revered among their tribes as conduits between the physical realm and the spirit world. More often than not those in the circle petition Luthic for divine assistance. With deep connections to the tribe and ancestral wisdom, they wield both spiritual guidance and formidable magic. Through rituals and trance-like states, they commune with spirits, seeking advice, healing, and insight to guide their clans through the challenges of orcish life. As keepers of tradition and guardians of spiritual balance, orcs within the fold of the Circle of the Spirit embody the essence of their people's resilience and spiritual strength.

#### Expanded Spell List

Starting at 2nd level, the wandering spirits teach you the secret of additional
spells. The following Spells are added to the boneshaker spell list
for you.

| Spell Level | Spells                             |
| :---------: | :--------------------------------- |
|     1st     | Find Familiar, Expeditious Retreat |
|     2nd     | Invisibility, Pass Without Trace   |
|     3rd     | Life Transference, Fly             |
|     4th     | Death Ward, Dimension Door         |

#### Spiritguide Initiate

Starting at 2nd level, you have learned the ways of Spiritwalking, the ability to
bolster spirits and transverse physical boundaries. You gain
another Communion Boon with which you can use your Spirit
Communion ability.

**Spiritual Bolster.** Through diligent meditation and reflection, you have mastered your own soul's energy. You can freely transfer this energy to others to uplift and bolster them. Roll a communion die and choose a creature you can touch. That creature recovers an expended spell slot of level X or lower. If that creature cannot recover a spell slot of that level, the creature instead gains temporary hit points equal to five times the number rolled.

#### Spiritwalk

Starting at 3rd level, you partially separate your soul from your body to enter the
Spiritwalk, the most basic of Spirit Circle traditions but also one
of the most dangerous.
:
As a bonus action, you may choose to
enter this special state of meditation. You may also choose to
enter your Spiritwalk whenever you cast a spell that requires
concentration (no action required). This lasts for up to 1 minute.
:
While in your Spiritwalk, you receive the following benefits and
restrictions:

- If you are concentrating on a spell, your concentration on that spell cannot be broken by taking damage, but you cannot cast a spell of 1st level or higher. Your speed increases by 10 feet and your movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity.
- You may move through space occupied by creatures' space without a movement penalty, and may move through hostile creatures' space no matter what size they are.
- You cannot take a reaction.
- You may enter a Spiritwalk twice and regain the ability to do so again after a long rest. You gain another use of this feature at 6th level and one more at 18th level.

#### Two Paths Diverged

Starting at 6th level, the finesse with which you summon and control spirits is
unparalleled. Whenever you use Spirit Magic to create a spell
slot, you may instead create two spell slots. The combined level
of these spell slots must equal X. For example, if you rolled your
Communion Die and rolled a 4, you may create 2 2nd-level
spell slots instead. These slots both last up to 1 hour, and if you
use Spirit Magic to create another spell slot, any remaining spell
slots created using this feature are lost.
Once you choose to use this feature, you may not do so
again until after you complete a long rest.

#### Numinous Divination

At 10th level, you have perfected the ability to separate your body and
spirit and send your spirit to distance locations. You learn the
scrying spell.

- You always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.
- You may choose to cast scrying as a ritual, ignoring all material components for the spell, as you send your soul on a journey to view remote events.
- You may cast scrying as a ritual twice in this way, you may
not do so again until after you have completed a long rest.

#### Spirit of the Journey

At 18th level, your tribe's ancient Gashna has taught you the powers of soul
transference and control.
:
As an action, you may force a
creature within 30 feet to make a Charisma saving throw
against your boneshaker spell save DC. On a failure, your Gashna
surges through them, dragging their spirit out and restraining it.
You and everything you are carrying and wearing disappears as
you turn into pure spiritual energy and possess the now vacant
body of your target.
:
Until this possession ends, the target is incapacitated, loses
control of its body, and in unaware of its surroundings. You now
control the body and cannot be targeted by any attack, spell, or
other effect, and you retain your alignment, your Intelligence
score, your Wisdom score, your Charisma score, and your
proficiencies. You otherwise use the target's statistics except for
its knowledge, feats, and proficiencies.
:
This possession lasts until either the body drops to 0 hit
points, a minute has passed, or you use your Action to end this
possession. When the possession ends, you reappear in an
unoccupied space within 5 feet of the body, and the original
spirit of the body returns with no memory of its time out of body.
Once you use this feature, you cannot do so again until after
you finish a long rest.

### Apostate

Boneshaker Apostates make pacts with spirits of the primal
elements, those of the elemental plane whose primordial
energies are said to have created the world. Apostates generally reject the invocation of ancestors and find even the petitiong of Orc gods to be a sign of weakness. Gruumsh is an uncaring god and if he were to share his wisdom, it would only be with those that could truly understand the primordial elements, the layer of chaotic energy over the world. The spiritual elitism and outward disdain they show for common orc practices often finds them in mixed company. Even spirits are cautious around apostates, as they know in the end the apostate will seek to dominate them, forcing the spirit to carry out their will.
:
The path of an apostate is usually a solitary one, with the most powerful having only met in the most dire and cataclysmic of circumstances. This has led to most practitioners following a master/apprentice dynamic. Most apprentices eventually turn away from this practice after their master dies (most likely by the hand of their student), since primal spirits are violent and unpredictable, but dedicated Apostates embrace this fear to command elements of great and awesome power.

| Spell Level | Spells                                  |
| :---------: | :-------------------------------------- |
|     1st     | Chromatic Orb, Tasha's Caustic Brew     |
|     2nd     | Melf's Acid Arrow, Aganazzar's Scorcher |
|     3rd     | Fireball, Lightning Bolt                |
|     4th     | Vitriolic Sphere, Storm Sphere          |
|     5th     | Cone of Cold, Immolation                |

#### Primordial Adept

At 2nd level, you have learned to better control the Primal Magics, the
elemental forces that make up the world. As a practitioner of the
Primal, you gain another Communion Boon with which you can
use your Spirit Communion ability.

- **Primal Protection.** You can alter the roiling flow of primal
energies and ward those you choose from harm. Roll a
communion die. You gain 1+X charges of Primal Protection.
These charges last for up to 1 hour, and if you use Primal
Protection again, you lose any charges you still had remaining.
You can spend Primal Protection in the following ways:
Anytime a creature you can see within 30 feet takes acid,
cold, fire, lighting, or thunder damage, you may use your
reaction and expend 1 charge of Primal Protection to grant
them resistance to the triggering damage type, including
against the triggering damage, until the start of your next
turn.

- You can use your action to spend 3 charges of Primal
Protection to touch one willing creature and grant them
resistance to either acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder. This
lasts for 1 hour.

- You can use your action to spend 7 charges of Primal
Protection to touch one willing creature and grant them
immunity to either acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder. This
lasts for 1 minute.

#### Elemental Rage

At 3rd level, you are able to enter a primal trance, a dangerous and volatile practice
known as the Elemental Rage. You seek to directly control the
primal elements around you by sheer force of will. As a bonus
action, you may choose to enter this special state of meditation
for up to one minute. You may also enter this state when you
deal acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage with a
Boneshaker Spell but before you roll for that damage (no action
required). While in your Elemental Rage, you receive the
following benefits and restrictions:

- You cannot concentrate on spells.
- Once per turn, you can reduce any acid, cold, fire, lightning,
or thunder damage you take by an amount equal to your
communion die + your wisdom modifier.
- You can only cast spells that deal acid, cold, fire, lightning, or
thunder damage.
- Once per turn, when you deal acid, cold, fire, lightning, or
thunder damage with a spell, you can add your communion
die + your wisdom modifier to one damage roll of that spell.
- You may enter an Elemental Rage twice and regain the ability
to do so again after a long rest. You gain another use of this
feature at 6th level and one more at 18th level.

{{pageNumber,auto}}
{{footnote BONESHAKER | APOSTATE}}

\page

#### Elemental Shift

At 6th level, you have learned to interchange the power of the elements with one another. If you cast a spell that does acid, cold, fire,
lightning, or thunder damage, you can spend 1 charge of Primal
Protection to change the damage type to acid, cold, fire,
lightning, or thunder damage.

#### Master of the Primeval

At 10th level, you learn the conjure elemental spell. You always have it
prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you
can prepare each day. Once per long rest, you may cast this
spell without expending a spell slot, and when you cast the spell
in this way, the elemental does not become hostile to you if you
break concentration on this spell.

#### Force of Chaos

At 18th level, the most ferocious, dangerous nature spirit has been drawn to your power and will heed your command, if you so call on it. This spirit manifests as the primordial itself, made
physical and visceral on the material plane.
:
As an action,
choose a point within 100 feet of you. The spirit manifests as a
wave of pure primal energy in a 30 foot radius centered on that
point. Each creature of your choice within that area must
succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your boneshaker spell
save DC or else take 2d10 acid damage, 2d10 cold damage,
2d10 fire damage, 2d10 lightning damage, and 2d10 thunder
damage and suffer an additional effect based on the primal
element of your choice from the table below.

| Element   | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| :-------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Acid      | The target is coated in caustic fluids and takes an additional 5d10 acid damage at the end of their next turn.                                                                                                                                                             |
| Cold      | The target's speed is reduced to 0. On its turn, the target must use its Action to make a Strength saving throw against your Boneshaker spell save DC to break the ice encasing it. On a success, it's speed returns to normal.                                            |
| Fire      | The target catches aflame, taking 2d10 fire damage at the start of each of its turns and becoming frightened of you. The target makes another Dexterity saving throw against your Boneshaker spell save DC at the end of each of its turn, ending the effect on a success. |
| Lightning | The target's system is shocked as lightning arcs through it. The target cannot make reactions or take bonus actions. The target makes a Constitution saving throw against your Boneshaker spell save DC at the end of each of its turn, ending the effect on a success.    |
| Thunder   | The target is knocked prone and deafened for 1 minute. The 30 foot radius area of Spirit of Chaos becomes difficult terrain as echoes of the thunder create a tumultuous sound fog that lingers low over the battlefield for the next minute.                              |

:
On a successful
save, a target only takes half damage and does not suffer an
additional effect.
Once you do this, you may not do so again until after you
finish a long rest.

## Additional Spells

#### Aftershock

*1st Level Evocation*
:
**Casting Time:** 1 action\
**Range:** 30 feet\
**Components:** V, S\
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
:
Summoning the primal storm, lightning leaps out from your
outstretched fingers towards a creature of your choice within
range. Make a ranged spell attack against that creature. On a
hit, the target takes 2d8 lightning damage and lightning swirls
around the target.
:
The next time you hit the target with a melee attack during
this spell's duration, your attack deals an extra 2d8 lightning
damage.
:
**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell
slot of 2nd level or higher, the number of times a melee weapon
attack can trigger this extra damage during the spell's duration
increases by 1 for each slot level above 1st.

#### Arc Lightning

*2nd Level Evocation*
:
**Casting Time:** 1 action\
**Range:** 30 feet\
**Components:** V, S, M\
**Duration:** Instantaneous
:
A bolt of lightning arcs toward a target of your choice which you
can see within range. Three other arcs then leap from that
target to as many as three other targets, each which must be
within 20 feet of the first target. A target can be a creature or an
object and can be targeted by only one of the bolt.
A target must make a Dexterity saving throw. The target takes
3d8 lightning damage on a failed save and half as much on a
successful save.
:
**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell
slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for
each slot above 2nd.

#### Frozen Tomb

*5th level Transmutation*
:

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
:
You invoke the name of Verglas, summoning the stoic spirits of
frosts to freeze your foes. Make a ranged spell attack against a
creature within range. On a hit, the creature takes 4d8 cold
damage and is covered in deadly frost.
The next time you hit the target with an attack during the
spell's duration, your attack deals an extra 4d8 cold damage,
and, if the creature is Large or smaller, it is petrified as a thick
shell of ice encases the creature. This ice melts at the end of
your next turn, freeing the creature from its petrification.

#### Jaarok's Echoing Mallet

*2nd Level Enchantment*
:
**Casting Time:** 1 Action\
**Range:** Self\
**Components:** V\
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute\
:
With the sound of thunder echoing across the high mountains,
you summon a furious mace within your hands. It lasts for the
duration. It counts as a simple melee weapon with which you
are proficient, it's damage die is a d10, and you can use your
spellcasting ability instead of Strength for the attack and
damage rolls of melee attacks using that weapon. The weapon
is considered magical, and when you cast this spell, you may
make one melee weapon attack against a creature within 5 feet
of you using this weapon. If you let go of the weapon, it
disappears, but you can evoke the mace again as a bonus
action.
:
After you hit with the weapon, you may immediately use your
bonus action to summon and strike a spectral gong, resounding
the blow again for all to bear witness. Each creature within 10
feet of you (excluding yourself) must make a Constitution saving
throw. On a failed save, a creature takes thunder damage equal
to the amount of damage dealt by the weapon's hit. On a
successful save, a creature takes half as much damage. After
doing this, the spell ends.
:
The weapon has a form of your choosing, but it must be a
club or mace in design. Many tribes carve unique totems into their weapons and may adorn
them with animal hides, bright feathers, or carved stone.
:
**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell
slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for
every two slot levels above 2nd.

**Range:** 60 feet\
**Components:** V, S, M (a shard of volcanic glass)\
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
:
You open a rocky vent to the volcanic core of the underdark. As
an action, choose a five foot cube of space you can see within
range. The ground erupts at that location in a molten fissure
that lasts for the spell's duration.

{{pageNumber,auto}}
{{footnote BONESHAKER | ADDITIONAL SPELLS}}

\page

Any creature that ends it's turn
within the spell's area must succeed on a Constitution saving
throw or else suffer a level of exhaustion from the immense
heat suffusing upwards.
:
As a bonus action on each of your turns, you can cause jets
of lava to erupt forth from each five foot cube of fissure dealing
2d6 fire damage to a creature within 10 feet of that fissure. A
creature cannot be targeted by more than a single jet of lava.
:
**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell
slot of 2nd level or higher, you can create additional fissures,
one additional fissure for each slot above 2nd. When choosing
the location of these extra fissures, you may arrange them as
you wish. Each fissure takes up a five foot cube and must have
at least one face adjacent to the face of another cube.

#### Molten Lash

*4th level evocation*
:
**Casting Time:** 1 Action\
**Range:** 30 feet\
**Components:** V, S\
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
:
You invoke the word of Pahoehoe, calling upon the destructive
nature of the fire spiirts. Make a ranged spell attack against a
creature within range. On a hit, the creature takes 3d10 fire
damage and starts to shine with a hazardous glow.
The next time you hit the target with an attack during the
spell's duration, your attack deals an extra 8d6 fire damage,
and the target explodes in a lava burst. Every other creature
within 15 feet of target (excluding you) must succeed on a
Dexterity saving throw or else take 8d6 fire damage.

\column

#### Totemic Attunement

*Abjuration cantrip*
:
**Casting Time:** 10 min\
**Range:** Touch\
**Components:** V, S, M (a knife made from the bones of an honorable creature, and a piece of wood or stone)\
**Duration:** Until Dispelled or Triggered
:
Over the duration of casting this spell, you carve a small
wooden totem, an esoteric tchotchke that you fill with your
magic. You can store a prepared spell of 1st level or higher by
expending an appropriate spell slot and storing the spell inside
the totem. While you hold the totem, you may use your action to
cast the spell stored within the totem without expending a spell
slot, after which the totem crumbles into dust.
:
You may only
have a single totem created at any time, and if you use this
cantrip to create another totem, any previous totem you created
loses its magic. Anyone who holds the totem might sense some
of the magic inside, a sensation fitting the nature of the spell.
For example, a totem containing burning hands might feel hot to
the touch.

#### Windfury

*3rd Level Enchantment*
:
**Casting Time:** 1 action\
**Range:** Self\
**Components:** V, S, M (a melee weapon)\
**Duration:** Instantaneous

of wind to empower your weapon. Make three melee weapon
attacks using the weapon used in the casting of this spell
against any creature within 5 feet of you.

slot of 4th level or higher, make an additional melee weapon
attack, one for every two slot levels above 3rd.

## Boss Brigade
:

Becoming a boss among orcs is more than just barking orders. Bosses are the students of Ilneval, and forge their own battle plans specifically crafted around the distinctive strengths of their allies, serving as a guiding force to deftly balance and amplify the skill of every warrior. When a boss organizes their fighting force into a brigade, their brigade fills a specialization they collectively spend years perfecting. Many an orc have racked up kills staying entrenched for months, holding a line that secures an important strategic position for their Warboss.

### Bulwark
Bosses who lead Bulwarks are the
anchor of the team. Plated with the toughest body and spirit,
the Boss provides their allies necessary protection to
grant them respite from enemy assaults and allow them to
move safely across hostile battlefields.

#### Heavy Plating
Starting when you form a Bulwark at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in heavy armor.

#### Defensive Position
Beginning at 3rd level, you become the anchor of the fight and your Bulwark's strength centers around you.
As an action, you can settle yourself into a defensive
position, reducing your movement speed to 5 feet. While in
your defensive position, you gain a bonus to your AC equal to
your Constitution modifier, and friendly creatures you choose
within 5 feet of you gain a bonus to their AC equal to your
shield's bonus. This effect persists until you are incapacitated
or you end it (no action required).

#### Additional Rally Effect
When you use your Rallying the Troops feature, you shout a
bolstering cheer that grants friendly creatures within range
temporary hit points equal to your Commander level.

#### Stubborn Defense
At 7th level, while you are at least Small, your body counts as
half cover for all friendly creatures. While you maintain your
defensive position, your body counts as three-quarters cover.

#### Aegis Fighter
Once you reach 11th level, as long as you have your shield,
you are never without a weapon. A standard shield now
counts as a martial melee weapon for you that deals 1d6 +
your Strength modifier bludgeoning damage with the
versatile (d8) and thrown (range 20/60) properties.

\column

#### Immovable Body, Immovable Spirit
Starting at 15th level, you gain proficiency in Constitution
saving throws.
:
In addition, whenever you fail an ability check or saving
throw that would subject you to a condition listed in
Appendix A of the Player's Handbook, or move you against
your will, you can choose to succeed instead.
Once you have used this feature, you cannot use it again
until you finish a long rest.

#### At Any Cost
At 18th level, unless you choose to end it, your defensive
position does not end until you die.
:

### Vanguard
Being the Boss of a Vanguard requires an iron gut and a heart
of steel. These Bosses charge headfirst into the
battlefield, using their steadfast confidence to strike fear into
their enemy and break open their ranks for their allies to
cleave through. Even in the most dire of situations, the Boss inspires their armies with unmatchable heroism.

#### Command from the Front
When you form a Vanguard at 3rd level you have advantage on initiative rolls.

#### Charging Strike
Also beginning at 3rd level, whenever you use the Dash
action, you can make one melee weapon attack or Shove
attack as part of your action.
:
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your
proficiency modifier. You regain all expended uses of this
feature after you finish a short or long rest.

#### Additional Rally Effect
When you use your Rallying the Troops feature, you lead an
envigorating charge. You and all friendly creatures within
range have their base movement speed(s) doubled until the
end of their next turn.

#### Cunning Combatant
Starting at 7th level, you can maneuver through the battlefield
in a whirlwind of speed. You can take a bonus action on each
of your turns in combat. This action can be used to take the
Dash, Disengage, or Help actions.

#### Finish Them!
Starting at 11th level, your attacks can create openings for
your allies to follow up on. Whenever you hit a creature that
has not taken damage in the combat yet with a weapon
attack, the next attack roll against that target before the start
of your next turn made by a creature other than you has
advantage.

#### Fleet Footwork
When you reach 15th level, your maneuverability on the
battlefield is nearly unimpeded. You gain the following
benefits:
- Your base walking speed increases by 10 feet.
- Your movement is not slowed by difficult terrain.
- Standing up from prone costs you only 5 feet of movement, rather than half your speed.
- Mounting or dismounting a creature costs you only 5 feet of movement, rather than half your speed.

#### Bahgtru Suffers No Cowards!
At 18th level, your agility and prowess over the battle has
become second nature. You no longer need to compete with
others for the first charge. You always have the highest
initiative in combat.

### Stratagem
An Orc Boss leading a Stratagem of officers is a towering presence of leadership and command among orcs. Renowned for their martial prowess and tactical acumen, they wield authority with an iron fist, overseeing officers who execute their orders with precision. These bosses inspire fierce loyalty and fear, orchestrating campaigns with calculated aggression and strategic brilliance to dominate their enemies.

#### Kill It Like This!
Starting when you take Position of the General at 3rd level,
you can use the Help action as a bonus action.
Additionally, when you use the help action to aid an ally in
attacking the creature, if the target is in your T actical Focus
and you can see or hear them, you can use the Help action
even if the target is not within 5 feet of you.

#### Additional Rally Effect
When you use your For the Horde! feature, you can
immediately reorganize your tactical approach. You can move
your T actical Focus to another point within range and issue a
battle command as part of the action you expend to use your
For the Horde! feature. Issuing a battle command in this
way does not expend any uses of your battle commands
granted by Tribal Leadership.

#### Mind of Ilneval
At 7th level, your strategic knowledge translates into superior
intellect. You gain proficiency in Intelligence saving throws
and two of the following skills that you choose: Arcana,
History, Investigation, Nature, or Religion.

#### I've Seen This Before...
Starting at 11th level, you learn to predict the enemy's attacks
before they make them, allowing you to reposition your allies
accordingly. Whenever a creature you can see makes an
attack roll against you, or a friendly creature in your T actical
Focus that can see or hear you, you can use your reaction to
impose disadvantage on the roll.
:
You can use this reaction a number of times equal to your
Charisma modifier (minimum of 1). You regain all expended
uses of this feature after you finish a long rest.

#### Always Three Steps Ahead
At 15th level, you are constantly calculating battle strategies
and preparing for contingencies. You and all friendly
creatures within 30 feet of you cannot be surprised while you
are conscious.

#### Ilneval's Champion
Once you reach 18th level, you know all battle commands.

### Horde
Fighting is not about camaraderie, nor vengence, nor glory,
nor principle. You fight for one purpose: to win. For the
the Boss that leads a Horde, your enemies are nothing more
than obstacles in your way to a greater, self-serving purpose.
Likewise, your allies are nothing more than the means to
your ends, tools at your disposal to lay waste to all who would
stand against you. The keepers of the ancient ways of orc warfare, the Horde is as inspiring as they are ruthless.
:
In times without conflict, Horde warriors are utilized as sentinels over sacred sites, as well as honor guard for Warbosses and nobility alike. They do not shirk this honor however, as they see themselves as keepers of the ancient ways in all aspects of orc culture.

#### Unerring Intimidation
Beginning when you take the Position of the Conqueror at
3rd level, whenever you make a Charisma (Intimidation)
check, you can treat any d20 roll of 7 or lower as an 8.

#### Subjugate
Also starting at 3rd level, whenever a friendly creature within
30 feet of you hits a target with a weapon attack, you can use
your reaction to make a weapon attack against the target,
provided you are within range.
:
You can use his feature a number of times equal to your
Charisma modifier (minimum of 1). You regain all expended
uses of this feature after you finish a long rest.

#### Additional Rally Effect
When you use your For the Horde! feature, you let out a
bloodcurdling howl that boils the blood of your nearby allies.
You and all friendly creatures within range gain additional
damage on their next weapon attack equal to your Charisma
modifier.

#### Expanding Influence
At 7th level, your influence over the battlefield grows as you
bring down your enemies. Whenever a creature you can see
dies, the space they occupied when they died counts as part
of your T actical Focus until the end of combat. This space
does not move when you move your T actical Focus.

#### There Can Only Be One
At 11th level, your iron fist grasps your allies so closely that
they are resistant to any demands originating from someone other than you. All creatures you choose within 60 feet of you
have advantage on saving throws made against effects such
as the command spell that would cause a creature to act
against their will.

#### Grovel Before The Horde!
Upon reaching 15th level, you can leverage the overwhelming
fear imposed by you and your forces to subdue your enemies
without even striking at them.
:
As an action, select a point you can see within 60 feet and
roll 10d10. The total is how many hit points of creatures this
feature can affect. Creatures within 20 feet that point who
can see or hear you are affected, in ascending order of their
current hit points (ignoring unconscious creatures).
:
Starting with the creature that has the lowest current hit
points, each creature affected by this feature is charmed by
you for 8 hours and falls prone. Subtract each creature’s hit
points from the total before moving on to the creature with
the next lowest hit points. A creature’s hit points must be
equal to or less than the remaining total for that creature to
be affected.
:
Once you have used this feature, you cannot use it again
unil you complete a short or long rest.

#### You, the Great
Once you reach 18th level, your indomitable might strikes
terror into the hearts of all those who might oppose you, save
for the strongest creatures in the realm. Attack rolls made by
creatures with fewer current hit points than you have
disadvantage.
